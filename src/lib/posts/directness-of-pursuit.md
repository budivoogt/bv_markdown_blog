To learn well, it helps to study the desired outcome directly.

Learn Italian by speaking Italian, rather than practicing with an app. Build a business by working on a project, rather than reading business books. I got this from Scott Young's great book Ultralearning.

I've been thinking about how this applies to my primary career goal of building a new software business.

My previous businesses were service based. Artist management, record label and publishing companies require people to take on more work, bring products to market and manage more accounts. It taught me much, but I'm excited to build something that exhibits more scaling properties. Software enables this.

I first got a taste of this with MusicCareers, a music industry job board. While I had scoped the product, I didn't develop it myself. I hired an agency and "product managed" them.

This was before I began coding. I now aspire to build a tech product myself.

In this typical indie hacker / solopreneur route, distribution is critical. An X or newsletter audience can be a springboard from which to launch projects. But my time is scarce, having just had a young daughter.

Most days I think about Scott's point of directness and wonder what the right way is to spend my time. Is it to write more or produce content? Or to practice coding? And if I'm practicing coding, should I work on practice projects, or just come up with a business idea which meets the bar and start working on that?

For now I'm putting content creation on the back seat while I work on coding projects. I'll create content when I'm inspired to. I know that's the right decision as coding is still hard for me and it takes discipline to get started and maintain momentum. Real learning's happening there. In contrast, writing is effortless when I have an idea I want to share.

I imagine that as I get further along this journey, I'll have more to say without subtracting much from the direct learning I should be doing.
