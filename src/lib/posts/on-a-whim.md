Yesterday I thought to myself: "I should try running again".

I hadn't run in years. It's never been my favourite form of exercise, as I like resistance training better.

In typical fashion, I considered researching how to begin running, worried about my gear and how to store my phone.

Then I realized all that was nonsense. To begin running, I simply had to run.

Today I put on my running shoes and went for it. To my surprise, I ran 40 minutes at a modest pace through our local forest. It was delightful!

It can be great to act on a burst of inspiration or curiosity. It's a nice way to overcome inertia and avoid overcomplicating things.
