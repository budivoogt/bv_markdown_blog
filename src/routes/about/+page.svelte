	<p class="prose">
		For the past decade, I was a music entrepreneur. I began managing my friends in university.
		Then I built record label, publishing and education companies. We developed artists from
		bedroom producers to performing globally at festivals like Coachella. We generated millions
		of streams. It was a marvelous journey, teaching me how to lead, operate and sell. In 2022
		we were acquired, allowing me to pursue my interests beyond music.
		<br /><br />
		I then built and sold a music industry job board. And dove into the world of crypto and venture
		capital. I founded a crypto DAO and angel investment syndicate for Media Tech and Future of Work.
		After 10 investments I realized that while supporting founders is cool, it's not as enjoyable
		to me as taking something from zero to one.
		<br /><br />
		That's why I want to build a new business. Something bootstrapped and scalable. I'm learning
		to code to be better equipped to build it. I'm working with SvelteKit, a full-stack framework
		I love. This blog is made with it. I'm sharing what I learn along the way here and
