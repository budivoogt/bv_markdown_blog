# Markdown blog with SvelteKit

Goal is to replace my personal [Budi Voogt](https://budivoogt.com/) and [Striking Markets](https://striking.markets/) sites with Markdown blogs hosted on Vercel or CloudFlare Pages.

# Tech stack

-   SvelteKit 2
-   Tailwind CSS
-   Prettier with prettier-plugin-tailwindcss and [prettier-plugin-svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/prettier-plugin-svelte)
-   [Shadcn-svelte](https://www.shadcn-svelte.com/docs) component collection
-   Supabase Postgres DB
-   Drizzle ORM
-   Supabase Auth

# Research questions

-   [] Will this structure need a database? If so, is it helpful if it's external?
-   [] How do I like working with Shadcn?
